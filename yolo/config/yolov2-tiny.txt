### This is a sample config file for yolo plugin and the trt-yolo-app
# Statements starting with '#' are ignored.

# The following 4 config params are required for yolo plugin and trt-yolo-app

# network_type : Type of network architecture. Choose from yolov2, yolov2-tiny, yolov3 and yolov3-tiny
# config_file_path  : Darknet cfg file
# wts_file_path : Darknet weights file
# labels_file_path : Text file with a list of object class labels

--network_type=yolov2-tiny
--config_file_path=data/yolov2-tiny.cfg
--wts_file_path=data/yolov2-tiny.weights
--labels_file_path=data/labels.txt

#Optional config params
# precision : Inference precision of the network
# calibration_table_path : Path to pre-generated calibration table. If flag is not set, a new calib table <network-type>-<precision>-calibration.table will be generated
# engine_file_path : Path to pre-generated engine(PLAN) file. If flag is not set, a new engine <network-type>-<precision>-<batch-size>.engine will be generated
# input_blob_name : Name of the input layer in the tensorRT engine file. Default value is 'data'
# print_perf_info : Print performance info on the console. Default value is false
# print_detection_info : Print detection info on the console. Default value is false
# calibration_images : Text file containing absolute paths of calibration images. Flag required if precision is kINT8 and there is no pre-generated calibration table
# prob_thresh : Probability threshold for detected objects. Default value is 0.5
# nms_thresh : IOU threshold for bounding box candidates. Default value is 0.5

#Uncomment the lines below to use a specific config param
--precision=kHALF
#--calibration_table_path=data/calibration/yolov2-tiny-calibration.table
#--engine_file_path=
#--print_prediction_info=true
#--print_perf_info=true


### Config params trt-yolo-app only

# test_images : [REQUIRED] Text file containing absolute paths of all the images to be used for inference. Default value is data/test_images.txt.
# batch_size : Set batch size for inference engine. Default value is 1.
# view_detections : Flag to view images overlayed with objects detected. Default value is false.
# save_detections : Flag to save images overlayed with objects detected. Default value is true.
# save_detections_path : Path where the images overlayed with bounding boxes are to be saved. Required param if save_detections is set to true.
# decode : Decode the detections. This can be set to false if benchmarking network for throughput only. Default value is true.
# seed : Seed for the random number generator. Default value is std::time(0)


#Uncomment the lines below to use a specific config param

#--batch_size=4
#--do_benchmark=true
#--view_detections=true
